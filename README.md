Overview:

This project aims to solve the minimum cost travel problem from city 1 to city 2 using Dynamic Programming. The trip involves multiple stopovers, with various choices for towns and hotels, each with different petrol and hotel costs. The program reads input from a file, calculates the optimal route with the lowest total cost, and displays both the best and alternative solutions. It also generates a DP table to demonstrate the cost calculations for each route. The results are presented through an intuitive user interface for clear visualization.
